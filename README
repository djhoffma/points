Points is a system for keeping track of points as a pseudo currency. It comes with a system for drawing names from a hat weighted by how many points users
have. It is designed as an incentive system in the workplace, but can be used in many other places. The entire system runs on the command line.

System Requirements:
Linux operating system
bash shell
awk, grep, and a few other common bash utilities

How to setup:
Clone this repository into the directory where you want to set up your system.

Make sure that you put a command into the file "template/generate-members" that, when run, gives a list
of linux usernames that will be a part of your system. This list includes administrators. You can use the variable %ROOT%
to represent the root of the directory where you cloned these files. An example is included in the download.

Second, make sure all of your administrators are in a single linux user group, such as h-consult. This can also be a single username, because every linux user also gets a group where they are the only member.

Look over global-paths.template and change the BASE_SCORE and ADMIN_BASE_SCORE variables as desired. The base score is what everyone starts as, and the admin base score
is how many points each administrator can give out.

Once all of the above are done, run 
make setup
and follow the on screen prompts.

How to use:
There are only 2 command the non-administrators will care about, there are give-points and display-points, these should be readable and executable by the
people who are in the points system.
display-points will display the point totals for all people in the system. It ignores the administrators.
give-points takes in a username and a number, and ives that many points to the specific username. This script will need to be setgid to work, unless
you want to make the scores file writable by all people in the system.

display-points
give-points USERNAME [NUMBER]
note: give-points defaults to 1 point if no number is specified.

Giving out prizes:
give-out-prizes NUMBER
will give out NUMBER amount of prizes to the members system (not including admins) with a weighted probability based on the number of points earned.
the prizes are numbered, and it assumes the users have an external system for numbering their own prizes and can actually give said prizes without assistance
from the computer.
